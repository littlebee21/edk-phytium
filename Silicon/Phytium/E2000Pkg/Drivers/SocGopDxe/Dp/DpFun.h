/**
  This 8-bit value contains information about the main link video stream clocking and color representation.
  The clocking mode is selected with bit 0 of the MAIN_STREAM_MISC0 register in the Main Stream Attributes
  block. When set to a '1', the link and stream clock are synchronous in which case the MVid and NVid values
  are a constant.In synchronous clock mode, the transmitter core uses the MVid and NVid register values
  programmed by the host processor via the APB interface.When bit 0 of the MAIN_STREAM_MISC0 register is set
  to a '0', then asynchronous clock mode is enabled and the relationship between MVid and NVid are not fixed.
  In this mode, the transmitter core will transmit a fixed value for NVid and the MVid value provided as a
  part of the clocking interface.
  bit 7:5 BIT_DEPTH: number of bits per color
          000 = 6 bits
          001 = 8 bits
          010 = 10 bits
  bit 2:1 COMPONENT_FORMAT: color representation format
          00 = RGB
          01 = YCbCr 4:2:2
          10 = YCbCr 4:4:4
          11 = Reserved
  bit 0   SYNCHRONOUS_CLOCK: clocking mode for the user data
          0 = asynchronous clock
          1 = synchronous clock

  @param[in]  BitDepth    Bit depth per color.For example , 6 means that Bit depth per color is 6 bits.
  @param[in]  CFormat     Color representation format. 0 - RGB , 1 - YCbCr 4:2:2 , 2 - YCbCr 4:4:4 , other - Reserved.
  @param[in]  ClockMode   Clocking mode for the user data. 0 - asynchronous clock , 1 - synchronous clock.

  Calculate the value of MVID.It is effective in the asynchronous clock mode.The clocking values for the main stream

/**
  Calculate the value of TRANSFER_UNIT_CONFIG_SRC_0 register.A transfer unit is a DisplayPort packet and represents
  both valid data symbols and stuffing symbols. This register value sets the size of a transfer unit in the transmitter
  framing logic.Due to the design of the core, only values that are a multiple of 4 are supported by this register.
  When configured for the Sparse TU mode, only the TRANSFER_UNIT_SIZE field of this register is valid. All other fields
  are ignored.
  bit 27:24   FRAC_SYMBOLS_PER_TU: sets the fractional number of valid symbols per TU in
              units of 1/16th. An accumulator is used to increase the number of data per transaction unit by 1 every 1/N TUs.
  bit 23:16   SYMBOLS_PER_TU: configures the number of valid symbols to transmit with each transaction unit. For most
              applications, this register can be set to a value of 64 (0x40) which allows the core to automatically manage
              the TU rate control. For bandwidth limited applications, this value can be set to any number less than or equal
              to 64.
  bit 6:0     TRANSFER_UNIT_SIZE: this number must be in the range of 32 to 64 for DisplayPort compliance and is typically
              set to a fixed value which depends on the inbound video mode.Larger values should be used for video modes with
              slower pixel clock rates. Smaller values should be used for video modes with higher pixel clock rates. The size
              of the TU is limited to integer multiples of 4. Settings that are not a multiple of 4 will be truncated to the
              lowest multiple.
  valid symbols per TU = tuSize * (pixelclock * bitDepth*3/8)/(lanecount*linkRate*100)

  @param[in]  PixelClock     pixel clock in KHz unit.
  @param[in]  LinkRate       Main link bandwidth in 10 Mbps unit.

  @param[in]  LaneCount      The number of lanes , 1.
  @param[in]  TuSize         Transfer unit size.This parameter is usually 64.
